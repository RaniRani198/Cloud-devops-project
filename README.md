### 🚀 End-to-End Deployment | Terraform + AKS + Docker + Prometheus + Grafana

This project is a **real-world simulation of a production-ready Cloud DevOps ecosystem** built on **Microsoft Azure**. It combines the power of **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**, **container orchestration with AKS**, and **modern observability tools (Prometheus & Grafana)** to deliver a complete DevOps lifecycle — from infrastructure provisioning to deployment and monitoring.

Whether you're targeting roles like **DevOps Engineer**, **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** or **Cloud Engineer** this project gives a clear hands-on expertise with cloud-native tools and principles such as:

- ✅ Automated, scalable infrastructure provisioning  
- ✅ Secure Docker-based microservice deployment  
- ✅ Real-time monitoring and visualized metrics  
- ✅ Robust Kubernetes orchestration in Azure environments
