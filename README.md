This project is a real-world simulation of a production-ready Cloud DevOps ecosystem built on Microsoft Azure. It combines the power of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), container orchestration with AKS and modern observability tools (Prometheus & Grafana) to deliver a complete DevOps lifecycle â€” from infrastructure provisioning to deployment and monitoring.

Whether you're targeting roles like DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) or Cloud Engineer, this project demonstrates your hands-on expertise with cloud-native tools and principles such as:
 -- Automated, scalable infrastructure provisioning
 -- Secure Docker-based microservice deployment
 -- Real-time monitoring and visualized metrics
 -- Robust Kubernetes orchestration in Azure environment
